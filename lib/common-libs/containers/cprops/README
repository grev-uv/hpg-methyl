cprops - c prototyping tools
============================

The c prototyping tools library consists of implementations for several widely 
used data structures and patterns, rudimentary tcp / httpd functionality and
a database abstraction layer. Object oriented development environments usually 
feature readymade implementations of such tools. 

Coding in c often allows better performance and closer control over application
behavior, which can be crucial in real life situations. libcprops provides 
generic tools for application development in plain c covering basic data 
structure implementations, persistence, threading and tcp communication. 

	data structures
	---------------
	o	linked list
	o	heap
	o	priority_list
	o	hashtable
	o	hashlist
	o	sorted hash
	o	AVL tree
	o	red-black tree
	o	splay tree
	o	N-ary tree
	o	PATRICIA tree - a character trie
	o	multimap - a data structure to support multiple indices
	
	application level
	-----------------
	o	cp_mempool, cp_shared_mempool - memory pool
	o	cp_thread - thread pool
	o	cp_client, cp_socket - tcp sockets
	o	cp_httpclient, cp_httpsocket - an HTTP socket api
	o	cp_dbms - a database abstraction layer


For your entertainment, the distribution comes with cpsvc, a web server based
on the cprops api and featuring support for CGI and cpsp, a c based page 
scripting environment. For more on cpsvc and cpsp see README under the svc/ 
directory.

Dependencies
============

 * libcprops relies on the POSIX threads api for synchronization features.

 * ssl features are implemented with OpenSSL. 

 * the build process uses libtool (see 
   http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html)

 * cp_dbms postgres support is based on libpq

 * cp_dbms mysql support is based on libmysqlclient
 
Compiling
=========
Once you've installed the library (see INSTALL), you should be able to compile
and link against either libcprops.a or libcprops.so, depending on the 
configuration settings you chose. Here's how you might compile the included
testhttpsrv.c program on linux:

$ gcc -D_REENTRANT -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500 -c testhttpsrv.c
$ gcc -o testhttpsrv testhttpsrv.o -lcprops -lpthread -lssl

on Solaris, add -lsocket to the link command.

Documentation
=============
In the works. Man pages for data structures as well as socket, thread pool and 
http socket apis are available under man3 directory. To see an overview of the 
library before installing try 

$ man -M . cprops
